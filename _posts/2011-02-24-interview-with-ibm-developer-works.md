---

In December, I was interviewed by [Andy Glover](http://thediscoblog.com/) for
the [IBM developerWorks podcast](http://lifeofthefreelancer.com/).  Today, that
interview was published.

I talked about [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/),
[JavaScript](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596517742?ie=UTF8&tag=rmm5t-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596517742),
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/),
[Sencha Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/),
[QUnit](http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit),
[Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/), [node.js](http://nodejs.org/),
[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), and my new venture
[BusyConf](http://busyconf.com/).
