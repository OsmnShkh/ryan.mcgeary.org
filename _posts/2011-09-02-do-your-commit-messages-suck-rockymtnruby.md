BOULDER, CO &mdash; [Rocky Mountain Ruby 2011][location] &mdash; Software
projects are collaborative.  They usually encompass many months or years and are
touched by several developers along the way.

Communication is key to any good software project.  Strong, well written, commit
messages are one way to increase communication and documentation with very
little overhead.

The project history plus a strong blame engine give us the power to answer
future questions about what we were thinking at the time something was added or
changed.
