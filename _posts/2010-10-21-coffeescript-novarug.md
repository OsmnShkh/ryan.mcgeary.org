NORFOLK, VIRGINIA &mdash; [NovaRUG][novarug] &mdash; I discovered
[CoffeeScript][coffeescript] during a recent project that [Jim Garvin][garvin]
and I were working on.  We knew the app was going to be heavy on the JavaScript,
and thatâ€™s how we started &ndash; writing straight JavaScript.  Even though I
have written JavaScript for years, this time, the JavaScript syntax itself got
in the way.  CoffeeScript's elegant syntax relieved us of this burden.

I quickly fell so in love with CoffeeScript that I have since sworn off writing
raw JavaScript directly ever again.  The goal of this talk is to convince the
audience to try CoffeeScript in hopes that they too will find it as valuable as
I did.
